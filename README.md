A simple version of the game Tetris for iOS, scaled to an iPhone 5. Based off of Bloc.io's Swiftris tutorial.

This version of Tetris was based off of Bloc.io's "Swiftris" tutorial. The original version (from their tutorial) had a Tetris 
game with one view which would immediately reset after every game was over. I have added a "game over" screen showing the score 
and level and a "play again" button to restart the game.
